# Kinetics

A Dash app showing the kinetics of a system involving one substrate (S) and a catalyst (C) to form a reactive intermediate (I).
I decomposes to form the product (P).
Three slider bars are available to change the values of the rate constants and explore the pre-equillibrium and steady-state kinetics.
